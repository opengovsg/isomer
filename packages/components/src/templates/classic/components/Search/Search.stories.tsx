        "Any public officer can build a good website Our team works on the belief that websites are important ways that the government shares information with citizens. As such, we want to help any public officer to set up a good website easily without any prior coding or design knowledge. We do this by making Isomer the defacto website builder for the government ‚Äì which enables any public officer to create userfriendly, reliable, costeffective, secure and fast websites.  The vision and mission üè¢ Isomer aims to empower the government to easily and effectively communicate with citizens through our websites. üë™ Citizens should be able to easily find and navigate information on Isomer websites.  Our history Isomer started as an  in 2020.  An internal study conducted by the Singapore government in 2017 found that over onethird of our government websites failed basic usability checks. Problems included website downtime, slow loading speed, and high cost. There was also poor website UX across different devices, and they were hard for citizens with visual disabilities to use. Isomer was created to provide government agencies with a simple and efficient way to create and host static websites. With Isomer, agencies can easily build usable, secure, and fast informational websites without the need for extensive technical expertise or resources.  Our website template has been pretested to ensure usability and accessibility for people with disabilities  Our static site architecture is designed for fast loading and eliminates many vulnerabilities, providing a secure and reliable platform for your website  We use automated monitoring to improve the reliability and security of your website, ensuring that it is always uptodate and protected against potential threats",
