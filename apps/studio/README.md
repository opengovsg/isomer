## Quickstart

Follow these instructions if you are familiar with building applications,
and/or are in a hurry to prepare an environment to work on your product.

If you are new, see our [Getting Started guide](https://opengovsg.github.io/starter-kit-docs/docs/getting-started/prerequisites).

If you are exploring what else you can do with Starter Kit,
a more comprehensive set of documentation, including guides
and tutorials, can be found [here](https://opengovsg.github.io/starter-kit-docs/).

### One-click deploy

We recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy your application.
A one-click deployment step is provided [below](#deployment), which will
also set up your own copy of this codebase on GitHub for you to work on.

This needs a few prerequisites, detailed below.

#### Prerequisites

The deployment needs a few environment variables to be set for it to function. They are:

| Name              | What It Is                                                                                                              | Example                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`    | The connection string for your database. This should have been obtained from Neon                                       | postgresql://user:pass@xyz.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/app?sslmode=require |
| `POSTMAN_API_KEY` | An API key to send email via Postman                                                                                    | asdfn_v1_6DBRljleevjsd9DHPThsKDVDSenssCwW9zfA8W2ddf/T                       |
| `SESSION_SECRET`  | A sequence of random characters used to protect session identifiers, generated by running `npx uuid` from your terminal | 66a21b98-fb17-4259-ac4f-e94d303ac894                                        |

#### Deployment

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fopengovsg%2Fstarter-kit%2Ftree%2Fmain&env=SESSION_SECRET)

## Working on your product

You may work on the codebase with:

- A [GitHub Codespace](#using-github-codespaces) provided by us, or;
- With your [local machine](#using-your-local-developer-environment).

### Using GitHub Codespaces

Follow the official GitHub [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository)
for developing with a codespace.

### Using your local developer environment

In summary:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Follow instructions for [running the app locally](#running-the-app-locally)

## Running the app locally

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Set environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development.local
```

Optionally set `POSTMAN_API_KEY` to send login OTP emails via [Postman](https://postman.gov.sg).
If not set, OTP emails will be logged to the console instead.e

#### Retrieving client-side environment variables in code

⚠️ When adding client-only environment variables in NextJS, you must prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to ensure that the variable is exposed to the browser. For example, if you want to add a variable called `MY_ENV_VAR`, you should add it to your `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MY_ENV_VAR`.

You will also need to update [src/env.mjs](src/env.mjs#L17) to explicitly reference the variable so NextJS will correctly bundle the environment variable into the client-side bundle.

### Start database

```bash
# Assumes that you have previously copied .env.example to .env.development.local
export $(grep DATABASE_URL .env.development.local | xargs) && npm run setup
```

### Start server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Developer Operations

> TODO: CI/CD test with GitHub Actions

> TODO: Github branch protection rules

# Useful notes

## Commands

```bash
npm run build      # runs `prisma generate` + `prisma migrate` + `next build`
npm run db:reset   # resets local db
npm run dev        # starts next.js
npm run setup      # starts postgres db + runs migrations + seed
npm run test-dev   # runs e2e tests on dev
npm run test-start # runs e2e tests on `next start` - build required before
npm run test:unit  # runs normal Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e   # runs e2e tests
```

## DB migrations

The following steps are needed before you can run migrations on a remote database in a private subnet of an AWS VPC.

First, ensure that you are connected to [AWS VPN](https://www.notion.so/opengov/Instructions-to-use-OGP-s-AWS-VPN-e67226703cac459999b84c02200a3940) as only the VPN is whitelisted to use the EC2 instance<sup>1</sup>.

Next, you will require the correct environment variables and credentials.

- Go into the 1PW Isomer vault and search for the `studio .ssh/.env.<staging | prod>` file.
- Create a folder named .ssh in the root directory and place the `.env` files there.
- Search for the credentials from the entry `AWS Isomer Next <env> Bastion SSH Key`- download the file `studio-vapt-bastion.pem`
- Put these credentials into the .ssh folder also.

Next, run the following command: `npm run jump:vapt`. This sets up the port-forwarding service.
Finally, run the following command in a separate terminal: `npm run migrate` to run the migration.

What happens under the hood is described below:
You need to set up a local port-forwarding service that forwards traffic from a specific local port, e.g. 5433, to the database via the bastion host (remember: the bastion host resides in the public subnet of the VPC and thus can be contactable from your computer).

- Open a terminal window and run the following command: `ssh -L 5433:<DB_HOST>:5432 <SSH_USER>@<SSH_HOST> -i <PATH_TO_SSH_HOST_PEM_FILE>`
- The `DB_HOST`, `SSH_USER` and `SSH_HOST` values can be found in the `ssm` keys on aws
- The `PEM_FILE` (the actual file) can be found in the `Isomer` 1Password vault as well, under the entry `AWS Isomer Next <env> Bastion SSH Key`. Download the file and save it to your computer. and update the file value for `PATH_TO_SSH_HOST_PEM_FILE`.

Finally, we want to run the migration script.

- Modify the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file so that Prisma connects to the local port-forwarding service at port 5433: `postgres://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASS>@127.0.0.1:5433/<DB_NAME>`
- Open another terminal window.
- Run `source .env`
- Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
