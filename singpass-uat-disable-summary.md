# SingPass UAT Environment Disable - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented changes to disable SingPass authentication on the UAT environment and assume it's always disabled in that environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Central Logic Update (`apps/studio/src/lib/growthbook.ts`)
- Modified the `getIsSingpassEnabled()` function to check for UAT environment
- Added environment import and UAT check that returns `false` when `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV === "uat"`
- This ensures SingPass is always disabled in UAT regardless of GrowthBook feature flag value

### 2. Server-side Page Router (`apps/studio/src/server/modules/page/page.router.ts`)
- Updated import to use `getIsSingpassEnabled` instead of direct feature flag access
- Modified the `publishPage` mutation to use the centralized function
- This ensures publish operations respect the UAT environment setting

### 3. Resource Service (`apps/studio/src/server/modules/resource/resource.service.ts`)
- Added environment import
- Updated the default parameter in `publishPageResource` function to check UAT environment
- This ensures resource publishing operations disable SingPass in UAT

### 4. Client-side Hook (`apps/studio/src/hooks/useIsSingpassEnabled.ts`)
- Added environment import and UAT check
- Modified the hook to return `false` when environment is "uat"
- This ensures client-side components properly disable SingPass in UAT

## Technical Details

### Environment Detection
- Uses `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` to detect the environment
- UAT environment is identified when the value equals `"uat"`
- This leverages the existing environment configuration system

### Approach
- **Centralized**: Main logic implemented in the central `getIsSingpassEnabled` function
- **Comprehensive**: Updated all direct usage points to use centralized logic
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved for non-UAT environments
- **Consistent**: Same logic applied across server-side and client-side code

### Coverage
The implementation covers:
- Server-side rendering and API endpoints
- Client-side React components and hooks
- Resource publishing operations
- Page publishing operations
- Background services and email notifications

## Verification
- Searched for all direct usage of SingPass feature flags
- Confirmed no bypassing of the centralized logic remains
- Test files reviewed and confirmed to be compatible with changes

## Result
SingPass authentication is now guaranteed to be disabled in the UAT environment across all parts of the application, regardless of GrowthBook feature flag configuration.
